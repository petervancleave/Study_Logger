# Start

A study logger application built with python. I wanted a way to manually time and store my total time spent studying so I built this. It's pretty simple right now, but I plan to build out a dashboard and a tagging system for more specific timing tasks.

## Usage

- Track study sessions with start/stop functionality
- View total time spent learning

## Data Storage
- Study sessions are stored in a local SQLite database (`tracker.db`)
- The database is automatically created when you first run the application
